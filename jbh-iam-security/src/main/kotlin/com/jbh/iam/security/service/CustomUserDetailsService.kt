/**
 * To authenticate a User or perform various role-based checks, Spring security needs to load users details somehow.
 *
 * For this purpose, It consists of an interface called UserDetailsService which has a single method that loads a user based on username-
 *
 * Note that, the loadUserByUsername() method returns a UserDetails object that Spring Security uses for performing various authentication and role based validations.

In our implementation, Weâ€™ll also define a custom UserPrincipal class that will implement UserDetails interface, and return the UserPrincipal object from loadUserByUsername() method.
